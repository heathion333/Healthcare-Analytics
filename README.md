#  Healthcare Analytics: Patient Visit Risk Tracker

This repository showcases SQL-driven insights into patient visit patterns, missed appointments, and risk stratification. Built with real-world healthcare logic, it supports hospital administrators in identifying high-risk patients and optimizing care delivery.

##  Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Simulated patient visit records with status and cost
- **Focus**: Missed appointments, average cost per visit, and patient risk levels
- **Tools Used**: SQL (PostgreSQL), Tableau (optional), Markdown commentary

##  Business Logic

Patients who miss multiple appointments are flagged as **High Risk**, enabling proactive outreach and care continuity. The query calculates:

- Total visits per patient
- Missed visit count
- Average cost per visit
- Risk status: `Stable`, `Monitor`, or `High Risk`

This logic supports:
- Reducing missed appointments
- Prioritizing patient follow-up
- Modeling cost impact of missed care
